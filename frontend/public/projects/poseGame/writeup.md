im-POSE-able was my quarter long project for [CMPM 180 - Special Topics](https://courses.engineering.ucsc.edu/courses/cmpm180) with Professor Samantha Gorman at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Inspired by the television show "hole in the wall", im-POSE-able is a game where players must contort their bodies to fit through holes in a moving wall. The game uses a webcam to track the player's body and determine if they successfully fit through the hole. Meanwhile, the player is unable to see the shape they must make, so they have to rely on the audience to guide (or mislead) them.

Unfortunately, there is currently no released version of this game due to size and hardware requirements. 

### My Contributions:
This project was developed entirely by myself with some invaluable feedback from peers and playtesters.

### Challenges and Solutions:
The largest problem I faced with this project was getting the on-screen character to reflect the player's movements with as little latency as possible. To this, I eventually settled on implementing a few Unreal libraries from the VTuber community and getting pose data from Google's MediaPipe AI.

### Project Takeaways:
This game was my first large project in Unreal Engine and taught me many basic virtual production skills, including:
- Motion capture and applying that to a 3D model
- Game Development in unreal
- Social Game Creation
