Vera is a Discord library built in Java to sit on top of the fabulous [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) to make quick bot creation as simple as possible. A lot of effort was put into making it possible for bots to be created in just a few lines of code while also working with all of Discord's interaction types. Vera is currently used by a few private discord bots created by friends.

### Motivation
JDA is an incredibly powerful library, but I often found that it took me a while to get basic commands implemented whenever I had to create a new discord bot. I usually ended up copying and pasting old code into my project and tweaking it to fit my needs. While there were other libraries that server a similar purpose to Vera, I felt that this would be a great opportunity to learn a new skill and create something that fits my needs perfectly.

### What I learned
- **Library Creation:** This was my first library project. I learned a ton about unit testing, packaging, distribution, and writing code that is designed to be called by other projects.
- **Software Design:** This was also my first project where design really mattered in my project. Everything I built was designed to be as easy for others to quickly understand. This meant that I had to have comprehensive javadocs, well structured files, and good pattern application.
