Pizza With Gun was my first large project in my game design program at UCSC. It is a platformer collectathon with procedurally placed rooms designed to make each playthough slightly different.
This project eventually inspired me to work on other, more advanced, procedural map generation techniques.

### My Contributions:
For this game, I primarily worked on level design, enemy programming, and other general game programming. I also helped design the level generation system which, unknown to us at the time, works similarly to how other games such as Spelunky work.

### What I learned
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** This project was my first experience implementing a pathfinding algorithm, A* in this case, in a game. While the current implementation is functional, I now recognize a few areas where it could be optimized and refined with ideas I learned later in my education.
- **Procedural Content Generation:** This was also my introduction to procedural content generation. We designed the level generation system entirely from scratch without referencing any other games. This project both taught me the basics of pcg and inspired me to take on more advanced pcg topics in future projects.
